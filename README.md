# SparkTech
An attempt to create a universal game cheating framework

# Disclaimer
This tool doesn't do anything by itself, it's a set of wrapper APIs which combined with a cheat core(+possibly bypass) allow faster development of cheat platforms, and allows script makers to create a single script which will work with multiple different platforms

# This is an early .NET version, which I decided to share
I've later developed a much more mature v2 version, using different tools, which isn't bound by CLR hosting limitations, however I will not be sharing it due to safety concerns and deals that I made with platform owners.
This one here however will continue to serve an educational purpose.
